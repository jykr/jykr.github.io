<p>I am a PhD student being advised by <a href="https://main.pinellolab.partners.org/">Luca Pinello</a> at Harvard University <a href="https://dbmi.hms.harvard.edu/education/big-phd-program">Bioinformatics &amp; Integrative Genomics Program</a> and Massachusetts General Hospital. </p>
<p>My research interest lies in developing computational methods to better study the gene regulatory relationship. I work with <strong>single cell genomics</strong> and <strong>CRISPR screen data</strong> to study the relationship between genomic features and variant functions. I am interested in building <strong>interpretable statistical methods</strong> and adopting <strong>machine learning methods used in natural language processing</strong> to the genomics data.</p>
