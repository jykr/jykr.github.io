### Invited Talk at Current Topics in Bioinformatics seminar series
*Nov 2021*  
Jointly presented SIMBA, a graph representation learning based single cell embedding method's [concepts and tutorials](https://simba-bio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) at the [Harvard Bioinformatics Core Bioinformatics Seminar Series](https://bioinformatics.sph.harvard.edu/current-bioinformatics-topics-workshops).


### SIMBA is posted on bioRxiv!
*Oct 2021*  
Excited to announce SIMBA, a graph representation learning based single cell embedding method is out on [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.10.17.464750v1)!


### Created CRISPR subgroup in Pinello lab
*Oct 2021*  
As our lab covers wide range of research topics and each member works on unique but generalizable components in the computational analysis of CRISPR data, I took initiative to create subgroup meeting dedicated to CRISPR related topics. 


### Joined the leadership team of HGWISE-ORIGIN
*Sep 2021*  
I joined the leadership team of [ORIGIN program](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/hgwise/origin) of Harvard Graduate Women in Science and Engineering (HGWISE) as the publicity coordinator. I'll be creating and distributing recruitment materials to excite and connect mentors to the young girls around the world passionate about STEM.


### Joined Pinello lab
*Jun 2021*  
I joined [Pinello lab](https://main.pinellolab.partners.org/) at MGH! I will continue working on my rotation project on single cell embedding method and start exploring more on CRISPR screen data.


### Passed Preliminary Qualifying Exam
*Apr 2021*  
I passed my PQE, I now am finally a PhD candidate!
