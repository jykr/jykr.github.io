### Awarded KASBP-MOGAM Scholarship
*Oct 2022*  
I was awarded the [KASBP-MOGAM Scholarship](https://kasbp.org/announcement/12967770), thanks for the support! 

### Presented poster at 2022 American Society of Human Genetics Conference
*Oct 2022*  
I presented our project on CRISPR base editor screen model in the 2022 American Society of Human Genetics Conference at Los Angeles.

### Presented poster at 2022 Impact of Genomic Variation on Function (IGVF) Annual Meeting
*Sep 2022*  
I presented our project on CRISPR base editor screen model “CRISPR Base Editor Reporter Screen with Bayesian Network Accurately Identifies Causal Variants of Cellular Low-Density Lipoprotein Uptake” in the 2022 Annual IGVF Meeting at Madison, Wisconsin.


### Hosted a Full-day CRISPR Tutorial at [30th Conference on Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology](https://www.iscb.org/ismb2022)
*July 2022*  
Our lab hosted a full-day CRISPR tutorial ["A Practical Introduction to the Design, Quantification, and Analysis of CRISPR Genome Editing Data"](https://www.iscb.org/ismb2022-program/tutorials#ip2) in the 30th Conference on Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology. 

### Lectured in NIH [Impact of Genomic Variation of Function (IGVF)](https://www.genome.gov/Funded-Programs-Projects/Impact-of-Genomic-Variation-on-Function-Consortium) CRISPR Workshop
*July 2022*  
I jointly held CRISPR Screen Design and Analysis Workshop with members of [Pinello lab](https://main.pinellolab.partners.org/) and [Sherwood lab](https://sherwoodlab.bwh.harvard.edu/) for IGVF community. I presented about the analysis methods of base editor CRISPR screens and its analysis methods.

### Invited Talk at Current Topics in Bioinformatics Seminar Series
*Nov 2021*  
Jointly presented SIMBA, a graph representation learning based single cell embedding method's [concepts and tutorials](https://simba-bio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) at the [Harvard Bioinformatics Core Bioinformatics Seminar Series](https://bioinformatics.sph.harvard.edu/current-bioinformatics-topics-workshops).


### SIMBA is posted on bioRxiv!
*Oct 2021*  
Excited to announce SIMBA, a graph representation learning based single cell embedding method is out on [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.10.17.464750v1)!


### Created CRISPR subgroup in Pinello lab
*Oct 2021*  
As our lab covers wide range of research topics and each member works on unique but generalizable components in the computational analysis of CRISPR data, I took initiative to create subgroup meeting dedicated to CRISPR related topics. 


### Joined the leadership team of HGWISE-ORIGIN
*Sep 2021*  
I joined the leadership team of [ORIGIN program](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/hgwise/origin) of Harvard Graduate Women in Science and Engineering (HGWISE) as the publicity coordinator. I'll be creating and distributing recruitment materials to excite and connect mentors to the young girls around the world passionate about STEM.


### Joined Pinello lab
*Jun 2021*  
I joined [Pinello lab](https://main.pinellolab.partners.org/) at MGH! I will continue working on my rotation project on single cell embedding method and start exploring more on CRISPR screen data.


### Passed Preliminary Qualifying Exam
*Apr 2021*  
I passed my PQE, I now am finally a PhD candidate!
